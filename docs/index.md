## Background

Data gathering can be cumbersome sometimes. This module tries to solve and simplify it. To make data gathering to influx-db a bit easier.

It tries to do so via WEB interface and for more advanced use cases - API.

Currently there are four main parts that user/operator can control:

- Measurements - Measurement to be processed from incoming Orion Context Broker subscription data and uploaded into influx-db. User defines entities and their types for the Orion Context Broker subscription. Also fields and tags to gather from the Orion Context Broker entity.
- Buckets - Used to define buckets of the influx-db. Allows to assign different measurements.
- Organizations -  Used to define organizations of the influx-db. Allows to assign different buckets.
- Subscriptions - Used to control selected measurement subscription. [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (Create, read, update and delete) principle. Main use case - automatically form the required subscription for the selected measurement and post it to Orion Context Broker.

It is based on Orion Context Broker entities and subscriptions, and is NGSIv2 compliant to process the incoming data into Line Protocol for influx-db.
